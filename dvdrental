#Using SELECT and WHERE to solve business problems.

// A customer lost their wallet at the store. Can you find their email address using their first and last name from their ID?

SELECT email FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Nancy' AND last_name = 'Thomas';

// A customer wants to know what the movie "Outlaw Hanky" is about. Can you give them the description for the movie?

SELECT description FROM film
WHERE title = 'Outlaw Hanky'

// A customer is late on their movie return, we've mailed them a letter to their address '259 Ipoh Drive'. We should also call them. Can you find their phone number?

SELECT phone FROM address
WHERE address = '259 Ipoh Drive'

#Using ORDER BY and LIMIT
//ORDER BY can be ordered using ASC or DESC
//You can also ORDER BY columns not selected in the SELECT statement

//LIMIT allows to limit the # of rows returned for a query (ex: top 20)

// For each store, can you order by the customers first name in from Z -> A?

SELECT * FROM customer
ORDER BY store_id, first_name DESC;

// What were the 5 most recent payments ( > $0)?

SELECT * FROM payment
WHERE amount != 0.00
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
LIMIT 5;

// We want to reward our first ten paying customers. What are their IDs?

SELECT customer_id FROM payment
WHERE amount != 0.00
ORDER BY payment_date ASC
LIMIT 10; 


// A customer wants to quickly rent a movie to watch over their short lunch break. What are the titles of the 5 shortest movies?

SELECT title FROM film
ORDER BY length ASC
LIMIT 5;

// If the customer can watch any movie that is 50 minutes of less, how many options do they have?

SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
WHERE length <= 50;


#Using BETWEEN
//The BETWEEN operation is the same as ">= AND =<" can also be negative -> NOT BETWEEN
//If using BETWEEN for dates, must be in ISO 8601 format -> YYYY-MM-DD
//If dates include timestamps, values past 00:00h will be excluded (ex: 2022-01-01 00:01H)

#Using IN operator
//IN allows for multiple WHERE conditions using commas seperate conditions

#Using LIKE (ILIKE) operator
//LIKE allows to perform pattern matching against string data with the use of wildcard characters
//Wildcard characters: % matches any sequence of characters
//underscore '_' matches any single character
//LIKE is case sensitive, ILIKE is not.

// Find all 'Cars' movie
WHERE title LIKE 'Cars _' would return Cars, Cars 1, Cars 2, ...

// Multiple underscores
for a formart suchas as 'Version#A4', 'Version#B2', ...
WHERE value LIKE 'Version#_ _'


//Pattern matching operators combined
WHERE name LIKE '_her%' would return Cheryl, Theresa, Sherri, ....

// How many customers have a first name that starts with J ?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%' /* Use ILIKE if first_name column isn't capitalized




// How many payment transactions were greater than $5?
SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5;

// How many actors have a first name that starts with the letter P?
SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM actor
WHERE first_name LIKE ('P%');

// How many unique districts are our customers from?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district) FROM address;

// Retrieve the list of those district names
SELECT DISTINCT district FROM address
ORDER BY district ASC;

// How many films have a rating of R and replacement cost between $5 and $15?
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
WHERE rating ='R'
AND
replacement_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 15;

// How many films have the word Truman somewhere in the title?
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
WHERE title ILIKE '%Truman%';
